    # Its value is always server specific unless we rely just on file size.
    # Such approach though is not really efficient, as file content can change,
    # but its size stays the same.
    #
    # INode by its nature is server specific. MTime has the same problem, as we
    # can't ensure that file will be cached at exactly the same time on all
    # dispatcher servers
