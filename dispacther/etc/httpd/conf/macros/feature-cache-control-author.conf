    # Disable ETag header
    #
    # Its value is always server specific unless we rely just on file size.
    # Such approach though is not really efficient, as file content can change,
    # but its size stays the same.
    #
    # INode by its nature is server specific. MTime has the same problem, as we
    # can't ensure that file will be cached at exactly the same time on all
    # dispatcher servers
    FileETag None
    Header unset ETag

    # Enabling cache for authoring
    #
    # We cannot cache all assets on author dispatcher because doing so
    # would require implementation of auth_checker/auth_handler.
    # But what we can do is cache responses in browser and ask it to
    # verify if those are valid with every requests. This basically
    # replaces almost all 200 status code with 304 which are smaller.
    Header always set Cache-Control "no-cache, max-age=604800"
